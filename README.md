# Flow-game in Java

this projet was made in an assignement for
[LIFAP7](https://offre-de-formations.univ-lyon1.fr/%2Fue-295-12%2Falgorithmique-et-programmation-orientee-objet.html)

the main idea of the projet was to recreate the flow game. 
This is the wikepdia explication of the [Flow-free game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_Free) that we are trying to create : 

The game presents Numberlink puzzles: each puzzle has a grid of squares with colored dots occupying some of the squares. The objective is to connect dots of the same color by drawing 'pipes' between them such that the entire grid is occupied by pipes. However, pipes may not intersect. Difficulty is primarily determined by the size of the grid
